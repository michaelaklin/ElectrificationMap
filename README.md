# ElectrificationMap
Code to create an interactive map (via Shiny apps) of new household electrification data. The map is online [here](https://aklin.shinyapps.io/ElectrificationMap/). This repo contains the code to recreate this app. 

## Background
For background on the data, see Aklin, MichaÃ«l, S.P. Harish and Johannes Urpelainen. 2018. "A Global Analysis of Progress in Household Electrification." _Energy Policy_ 122: 421-428.
